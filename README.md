**Message Hiding in Images**
- This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python, Tkinter, and the stegano library to hide and reveal secret messages in images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography.

- **Features**
- Hide Message in Image: Allows users to select an image (PNG or JPG) and hide a secret message within it using a simple password-based protection system.
- Reveal Hidden Message: Users can reveal the hidden message from an image by entering the correct password.
- Save Modified Image: The modified image with the hidden message can be saved locally for future use.
- User-Friendly GUI: Built using Python's Tkinter library, the application provides a straightforward and interactive interface for users.
- **How It Works**
- Open an Image: Users can select an image file from their local system to use as a carrier for the hidden message.
- Hide a Message: After entering the correct password, users can type a message into the provided text area. The message is then hidden in the image using LSB steganography.
- Save the Image: The image with the hidden message can be saved locally.
- Reveal the Message: If an image contains a hidden message, it can be revealed by entering the correct password.

- **Dependencies**
- Python 3.x: The application is written in Python and requires Python 3.x to run.
- Tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
- Pillow (PIL Fork): A Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
- Stegano: A simple Python library for steganography, focusing on LSB steganography.
